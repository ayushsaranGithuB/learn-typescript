## Narrowing is the process of **refining** types to a more specific type than originally declared.

In this lesson, we’ll dive into the concepts of _narrowing_ and _type guards_ in TypeScript. Narrowing allows us to refine a more general type to a more specific one, enabling safer and more precise code.

**Type guards** are the techniques we use to perform this narrowing, ensuring that we can confidently access properties or methods on a value.

By mastering these concepts, we’ll be better equipped to handle complex types and avoid common runtime errors in our TypeScript projects.
