# Intro to typescript

In this module you'll find an introduction to Typescript and its how it can make your life better as a developer.

We will cover the history of Typescript, its application in modern programming and its relationship with JavaScript.

## Pre-Requisites

This course assumes that you are already familiar with JavaScript and comfortable with HTML and CSS. If not go back to the Modern JavaScript tutorial and brush up on basic HTML and CSS before you take this course.

You will need access to a computer and IDE environment to follow along. I recommend VSCode as an IDE but you can use any code editor that you are familiar with.

You will need to run some terminal commands so basic familiarity with the terminal or windows PowerShell is a plus. And you should already have Node.js installed on your computer. If not then go here and download the correct installer for your OS environment.

That's it let Get Started, happy coding!
