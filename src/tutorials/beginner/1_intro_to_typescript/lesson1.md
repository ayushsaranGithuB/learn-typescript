# What is typescript

TypeScript is a 'syntactic superset' of JavaScript which adds static typing. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft.

A "Syntactic Superset" means that it shares the same base syntax as JavaScript, but adds something to it.

This basically means that all Javascript is valid TypeScript, since Typescript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

TypeScript was created to address the challenges of building large-scale JavaScript applications and adds optional type annotations, classes, interfaces, and other features to the language to assist in development.

In the next lesson we will look into how it's useful, why you should use it, and how it can make your life easier as a programmer.
