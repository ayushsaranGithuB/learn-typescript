# Review

Before we move on to setting up and trying out Typescript on our machines let's review what we learnt in this chapter

- TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.

- TypeScript adds optional type annotations while JavaScript is completely dynamically-typed.

- Adding type annotations and other features such as interfaces, classes, and namespaces means we can specify the data type of variables, parameters, and return values, which can help catch type-related errors at compile-time.

- Typescript is fully compatible with existing code, because it's compiled into plain Javascript for delivery, which means you can add TypeScript into any existing JavaScript environment.

With these basics covered let's move on to Setting up a project with Typescript.
