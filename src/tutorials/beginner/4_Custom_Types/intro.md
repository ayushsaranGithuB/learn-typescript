# Custom Types

In TypeScript, custom types are powerful tools that allow you to define your own type structures, enabling you to model more complex data and enforce specific constraints in your code. Whether you’re working with objects, unions, or intersections, custom types help you create more descriptive and maintainable code by ensuring that your data adheres to the shapes and formats you expect.

## Custom types provide a way to:

- **Encapsulate Complex Data:** Define shapes for objects that include specific properties and types.
- **Enhance Code Readability:** Give meaningful names to data structures, making your code easier to understand.
- **Improve Type Safety:** Enforce strict type checks, reducing the likelihood of errors and bugs.
- **Promote Reusability:** Create reusable and consistent types that can be used throughout your application.

In this chapter, we’ll explore how to create and use custom types, covering topics like type aliases, interfaces, and more advanced concepts like union and intersection types. By the end, you’ll be able to define your own types that make your TypeScript code more robust and easier to work with.
