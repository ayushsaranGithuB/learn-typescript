# Generics

#### Objective:

- Understand the concept of generics in TypeScript.
- Learn how to define and use generic types, functions, and classes to create reusable and flexible code.

### Introduction

Generics provide a way to create reusable components that can work with a variety of types rather than a single one. 

Generics allow you to define functions, interfaces, and classes that can operate on types specified by the user, offering flexibility and type safety.
