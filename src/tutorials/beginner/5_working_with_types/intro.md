Understanding and effectively working with types is fundamental in TypeScript.

This chapter will explore key concepts that enhance type safety and flexibility in your code. You'll learn about:

1. **Type Assertions**: Techniques to explicitly inform the TypeScript compiler about variable types.
2. **Type Compatibility**: Ensuring that different types can work together seamlessly, leveraging TypeScript's structural type system.

By mastering these concepts, you'll be equipped to write more robust, maintainable, and expressive TypeScript code.
