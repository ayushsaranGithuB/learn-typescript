# DOM Manipulation in Typescript

When building web applications, interacting with the DOM is essential for creating dynamic and interactive user experiences. In this chapter, we’ll explore how to use TypeScript to interact with and manipulate the DOM.

TypeScript brings additional benefits to this process by providing type safety, which helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime.

Throughout this chapter, you’ll learn how to select and modify elements on your web page, handle user events, and even create reusable TypeScript functions for common DOM tasks. By the end, you'll be able to confidently apply TypeScript to your everyday front-end development tasks, making your code more robust and maintainable.

Pre Requisites:  
 - **DOM Elements**: Basic familiarity with HTML elements and their properties. - **Event Handling**: Understanding how to add and manage events in JavaScript, which will translate directly to TypeScript.
