			TypeScript is Open-Source, So Learning It Should Be Too?
		</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<h4>
				I built this project because I was tired of running across paywalls, popups and upsells on all the other learning websites.
			</h4>
			<p>
				Learning TypeScript should be accessible to everyone, without the frustration of being interrupted by ads or pressured into paying for 'premium' content.
			</p>
			<p>
				The open-source nature of TypeScript inspired me to create a learning platform that's just as open—free from barriers, so you can focus on what really matters: Learning Typescript.
			</p>
			<h3>
				This project is built on the belief that education, especially in the realm of programming, should be as accessible and open as the tools we use every day.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to deepen your TypeScript skills or a newcomer eager to learn, you deserve a resource that's transparent, straightforward, and completely free.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every lesson, exercise, and project is designed with one goal in mind: to provide you with a high-quality learning experience that doesn't come with strings attached. Here, you can learn at your own pace, without worrying about subscription costs or unnecessary distractions.
			</p>
			<p>
				By keeping the learning process as open-source as TypeScript itself, we aim to foster a community where knowledge is shared freely, and everyone has the opportunity to grow and succeed."
			</p>

			<h4>
				To keep with the spirit of openness, this entire project is not only free to use but also open-source and shared under the Creative Commons license.
			</h4>

			<p>
				This means you can access, share, and even contribute to the content freely.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am constantly striving to improve this website, and your feedback is invaluable.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you find any errors or have suggestions for how I can make this learning platform better, please file a bug or share your thoughts on the GitHub issues page for this project here:

				Together, we can continue to build and refine this resource, making it the best possible place to learn TypeScript for everyone.

			<h3>
				Video Tutorials
