# Typescript For Everyone

TypeScript is Open-Source, So Learning It Should Be Too?



I built this project because I was tired of running across paywalls, popups and upsells on all the other learning websites.
Learning TypeScript should be accessible to everyone, without the frustration of being interrupted by ads or pressured into paying for 'premium' content.

The open-source nature of TypeScript inspired me to create a learning platform that's just as open—free from barriers, so you can focus on what really matters: Learning Typescript.

## This project is built on the belief that education, especially in the realm of programming, should be as accessible and open as the tools we use every day.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to deepen your TypeScript skills or a newcomer eager to learn, you deserve a resource that's transparent, straightforward, and completely free.

Every lesson, exercise, and project is designed with one goal in mind: to provide you with a high-quality learning experience that doesn't come with strings attached. Here, you can learn at your own pace, without worrying about subscription costs or unnecessary distractions.

By keeping the learning process as open-source as TypeScript itself, we aim to foster a community where knowledge is shared freely, and everyone has the opportunity to grow and succeed."

## To keep with the spirit of openness, this entire project is not only free to use but also open-source and shared under the Creative Commons license.
This means you can access, share, and even contribute to the content freely.

I am constantly striving to improve this website, and your feedback is invaluable.

If you find any errors or have suggestions for how I can make this learning platform better, please file a bug or share your thoughts on the GitHub issues page for this project

Together, we can continue to build and refine this resource, making it the best possible place to learn TypeScript for everyone.

# Other Resources
There are tons of excellent resources to learn TypeScript out there on the web.

Here are some that I personally recommend:

## Video Tutorials
Sometimes It's just easier to watch rather than read about something and seeing someone else work through a project makes it feel less daunting to get started, so here are some I enjoyed watching and learnt a lot from:
